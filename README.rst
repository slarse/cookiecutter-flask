cookiecutter-flask
******************
This is a basic cookiecutter template for how I like my ``Flask`` apps.
It comes complete with a binary script for running the app.

Requirements
============
The only requirement for using this template is to have ``cookiecutter`` installed.
It can be installed from ``PyPi`` with ``pip install cookiecutter``.

Quick-usage
===========
1. Execute ``cookiecutter gh:slarse/cookiecutter-flask``
2. Complete the setup.
3. Done! To run the app, ``cd`` into the project directory and execute
   ``pip install -e .`` (editable install) and then ``<app_name> runserver``.
